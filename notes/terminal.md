finally, i'm here in my new file that I can push to github and keep all my notes in synced to anywhere I can access the web and login to github, so have to use phone maybe to login but yay, access to all my code from anywhere!
This line added from github on browswer. Will it be overwritten? Must I simply remember to pull after adding this? Hmmm, testing.
This line is from the terminal. Will it be added automatically into VSCode?
Above line resulted in swap file on VSCode but successfully incorporated during push to github. Not sure what to do with swap file: ignore/delete? Will this entry make another swap file or add to the first? WHat if I close this terminal file before push?
