finally, i'm here in my new file that I can push to github and keep all my notes in synced to anywhere I can access the web and login to github, so have to use phone maybe to login but yay, access to all my code from anywhere!
This line added from github on browswer. Will it be overwritten? Must I simply remember to pull after adding this? Hmmm, testing.
This line is from the terminal. Will it be added automatically into VSCode?
