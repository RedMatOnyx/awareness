Still wondering why some of these don't work, and how to find rss feeds to use...
Will maybe try the following and experiment:

These feeds generally allow direct JavaScript fetching:

BBC News (JSON & RSS)

RSS: https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml

JSON: https://api.bbc.com/feed/1.0/news/

Hacker News (Tech News & Startups)

RSS: https://news.ycombinator.com/rss

NPR News

RSS: https://feeds.npr.org/1001/rss.xml

NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)

RSS: https://apod.nasa.gov/apod.rss

Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Web Docs

RSS: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/RSS

Reddit (Public Subreddit Feeds, but requires CORS proxy)

Example: https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/.rss

Note: Reddit blocks direct JS fetches from browsers, so a proxy is needed.

Google News: https://news.google.com/rss

NY Times: https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml

CNN: http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss

Reuters: http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/topNews

The Guardian: https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss
